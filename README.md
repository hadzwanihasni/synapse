# 🧠 SYNAPSE — System for Navigating AI-Powered Strategy & Execution

> *“Where co-pilot intelligence meets transformation design.”*

**SYNAPSE** is the modular intelligence engine inside the STRATOS ecosystem — designed to orchestrate agent-powered systems that support opportunity discovery, solution architecture, automation engineering, deployment rollout, and continuous improvement.

This framework forms the logic layer of STRATOS, enabling AI-native workflows, structured agent collaboration, and scalable co-pilot orchestration across domains like operations, enablement, and digital transformation.

## 🧩 What is SYNAPSE?

SYNAPSE brings together modular **co-pilot agents**, each aligned to a phase of transformation:

- **OPTRIX** – Opportunity Mapper  
- **ARCHYX** – Solution Architect  
- **ENGENA** – Automation Engineer  
- **LAUNIX** – Deployment Strategist  
- **EVOLIX** – Improvement & Scale Assistant

Each agent is powered by structured prompts, memory strategies, and lifecycle logic — enabling repeatable transformation at scale.

## 💡 Project Status

As development continues in parallel streams, this space captures the system thinking, agent roles, and orchestration patterns shaping the SYNAPSE intelligence layer. It serves as a public anchor for the framework's evolution — with full documentation, co-pilot integration logic, and modular design templates to be released in future phases.

> SYNAPSE is not just agent logic — it’s system logic.
